    <h2>Recent Work</h2>
    <p>Non-profit. Transparent. Both radically innovative and humane.</p>
	<p>Mentioned by the Obama team as a role model for what health care in America could be,
	should be. Group Health had everything going for it except a true voice, one without bullshit or compromise, something that would take them away from the persistant stigma of 'Group Death'. We just wanted honest. Fearless. True about what's wrong with health care. And what must be done to make it right. Thank you Matt Clark and Brian Homman from Loaded Pictures and Kelly Vander Linda from Collective. Once again, a perfect team.</p>
