    <h2>How do I work with Switzerland or find out more?</h2>
    <p>Email or call <a href="mailto:jay@switzerlandwest.com">Jay</a> or
    <a href="mailto:derek@switzerlandwest.com">Derek</a>. We’d love to hear about your project, find out what you need, or just
    give you a&nbsp;POV.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
  
  <h2>What types of services do you offer?</h2>

  <p>Switzerland offers three services that can be combined or contracted individually: <a href="/production.html">production</a>,
  <a href="/creative.html">creative</a>, and <a href="/business_affairs.html">business&nsbp;affairs</a>. </p>
  
   </div>
   <div class="slide">
     <h2>Do you compete with ad agencies? Are you an ad agency in&nbsp;disguise?</h2>

  <p>Nope. We have no desire to be agency of record for any client. We love advertising agencies since that’s where we all
  began. We’ve seen the good, bad, and ugly in this game so agencies large and small should see us as a resource. We’ve been
  able to make all the agencies that work with us look really good to&nbsp;clients.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h2>Why do you have creatives on staff if you’re not&nbsp;competitive?</h2>

  <p>It’s true that our creatives are some of the best on the planet. But they play a different role here – they assist
  agencies, clients, production companies, whoever we work with in creating or consulting on concepts; pitching; taking
  concepts through&nbsp;production.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h2>What’s the difference?</h2>

  <p>The only thing we ask whether you are an agency, client, or production company is that if a Switzerland idea gets
  approved for production, our creatives see it all the way through. If the idea isn’t bought, we’ll keep it for when
  they’re&nbsp;ready.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h2>Are the producers and creatives on staff?</h2>

  <p>Yes and no.</p>
  
  <p>We have a group of core employees but we work in the same way a production company does – we scale up and down
  according to your needs. We do exclusive deals with many of the best creatives and producers in the business. Derek and Jay
  personally oversee every project so you’ll be in good&nbsp;hands. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h2>I’m an interactive agency. Can I work with you?</h2>

  <p>Yes. Yes. And yes. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="slide">
  <h2>So how much do you know about technology?</h2>

  <p>A lot. We know tech culture very, very well and know how to speak that language. As creatives we’ve worked on Microsoft,
  Apple, Google, HP, Sun Microsystems, T-Mobile and a host of others. As producers we’ve produced launch campaigns for Apple,
  HP, Microsoft, Gateway, T-Mobile, RIM, among others. Steve Jobs – you may have heard of him – has world premiered our Apple
  ads so often over the years, it’s hard to keep&nbsp;track.</p>
