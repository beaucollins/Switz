<p>Business Manager. Negotiator. Cheapskate. Knows that what ends up on air and in print is more important than breathing.
Makes sure that what the creatives and the producer want happens &ndash; whether it&#x27;s licensing that Shakespeare episode
of Gilligan&#x27;s Island, chatting up the James Dean estate or staring down a network. Created, then supervised, the
business affairs departments at Wieden &amp; Kennedy for over 6 years and Leagas-Delaney for over 5. Work for clients such as
Nike, Adidas, Coke, MINI, Priceline, Alaska Airlines, Quiznos, HP, Barclays Bank, and ESPN. Will keep you from getting sued.
Will save you time, and, perhaps more importantly,&nbsp;money.</p>
