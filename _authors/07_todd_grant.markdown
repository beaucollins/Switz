## Todd Grant

Creative Director. Art Director. Ukeleleist. Can&rsquo;t stand fussy people. During his career, Todd
has worked on an impressive roster of brands including Adidas, Porsche, Budweiser, Nike, GotMilk and
HP. During his nine years at Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners, Todd co-created the iconic
Budweiser Lizards, launched the Invent tagline for HP, and had a lot of painful dental work done.
Has won so many Cannes Lions, he could melt them all in a forge and make a giant fruit bowl. Knows
art + commerce not only go hand in hand, but occasionally fall in love and live happily
ever&nbsp;after.
