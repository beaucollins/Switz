## Jim Riswold

Writer. Creative Director. Pop Culture Avatar. Teacher. Artist. Disciplinarian. With a resume that
reads like a history of contemporary advertising, began as the first copywriter ever hired at Wieden
+ Kennedy. Named by Newsweek as one of the 100 most influential people in American culture. Creator
of such iconic spots as the Michael Jordan/Spike Lee Nike campaigns, &lsquo;Bo Knows,&rsquo; Charles
Barkley&rsquo;s &lsquo;I Am Not A Role Model&rsquo; and &lsquo;I Am Tiger Woods.&rsquo; Artist and
photographer with permanent collections in several museums. Winner of too many awards to mention
although he&rsquo;d like us to. Teaches advertising in his spare time, benevolently terrorizing his
pupils into&nbsp;greatness.
