## Charlotte Moore

Art Director. Creative Director. Book designer and co-author. Sometimes lone writer. Bi-lingual
American in Milan. This [professional schizophrenic] spent 7-1/2 years at Wieden + Kennedy/Portland
and Amsterdam multiplying her personalities on iconic work for Nike, [Nike Women&rsquo;s Fitness],
Coke&rsquo;s outrageous OK Soda, and the launch of Windows &rsquo;95. On the &ldquo;old world&rdquo;
side of the Atlantic, she&rsquo;s consulted on top European brands such as Ferrero, Telecom Italia
and Adidas. Recognized by the One Club, Addy&rsquo;s, Cannes, the Smithsonian, McCall&rsquo;s and
MFP Kelly for the best print campaign in American 2 years running, her greatest personal reward is
being able to change her mind, her continent and which language to curse&nbsp;in.
