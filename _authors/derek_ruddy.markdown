## Derek Ruddy

Producer. Mediator. Consigliere. Babysitter. Believes that money should end up on the screen not
with a holding company. Nine years at Wieden + Kennedy producing iconic work for Nike, ESPN, Coke,
Microsoft and Subaru to name a few. Winner of the Cannes Palme D&rsquo;Or for the highly regarded
Nike &lsquo;Seville&rsquo; TV Spot, which gave the world a singing, and Italian, Sir Charles
Barkley. Executive Producer for 6 years at Publicis, heading up a 25-member production department,
helping to create memorable branding for T-Mobile, Citibank and Washington&rsquo;s Lottery. Believes
awards don&rsquo;t really matter, yet continues to use the many he&rsquo;s received over the years
as decorative ornamentation anyway. Thinks the work really does come&nbsp;first.
