## Glenn Rockowitz

Writer. Comedian. Philanthropist. Self-loathing Jew. Breaker-down of walls. Stand-up comedian and
television writer for 15 years. Survived so many cancers he now has a buy-one-get-one-free card.
Thankfully lived to write a painfully passionate bestselling memoir about it. Fell backwards into
advertising and has produced a wealth of iconic, award-winning work that he&rsquo;d probably rather
not talk about. More proud of his other accomplishments: [his book], [his film], and his non-profit
work. Will happily provide additional self-congratulatory details of his illustrious life
upon&nbsp;request.
