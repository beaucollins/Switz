## Glenn Rockowitz


Bestselling Author. Former TV Writer. Comedian. Patient Advocate. Rockowitz fell backwards into advertising and has produced a good share of iconic, award-winning work that is sampled here on this site. _[Rodeo in Joliet]_ , a memoir chronicling the death of his father and his own fight back from a terminal cancer diagnosis, officially became a national bestseller in March of last year and was a finalist for _US Book News&rsquo;_ &ldquo;Best Books of 2010.&rdquo; He recently started [Change it Back], an Adolescent &amp; Young Adult cancer coalition designed to improve treatment standards for AYA patients around the country. He will happily provide additional self-congratulatory details of his life upon request. Although he doubts you even made it this far.
