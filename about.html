<h2>about</h2>
<p>Derek Ruddy and Jay Howard founded Switzerland LLC in 2008 because it was time for something different. A place with
award-winning, sought-after producers and creatives under one virtual roof, providing quality independent production and
management. We&rsquo;re a production company, not an ad agency. And our expertise lies in three distinct yet overlapping areas:
production, creative, business affairs. We believe we do our jobs better than anybody else out&nbsp;there. </p>

<p>Everyone at Switzerland believes in the power of storytelling and the absolute necessity of getting that storytelling out
in the world. It&rsquo;s not where you put the message; that will always evolve. It&rsquo;s the message you put out. We&rsquo;re all only
limited by the depth and breadth of the idea. It&rsquo;s not complex. Switzerland makes it&nbsp;simple.</p>

<p>Why &lsquo;Switzerland&rsquo;? We wanted a name that stands for how we work and get along with almost all types of organizations.
We&rsquo;re not so much neutral, as flexible. And aesthetically, it doesn&rsquo;t get much better than&nbsp;Switzerland. </p>
