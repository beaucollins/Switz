<h2>JIM RISWOLD</h2>
<p>Writer. Creative Director. Pop Culture Avatar. Teacher. Artist. Disciplinarian. With a resume that reads like a history of
contemporary advertising, began as the first copywriter ever hired at Wieden + Kennedy. Named by Newsweek as one of the 100
most influential people in American culture. Creator of such iconic spots as the Michael Jordan/Spike Lee Nike campaigns,
&lsquo;Bo Knows,&rsquo; Charles Barkley&rsquo;s &lsquo;I Am Not A Role Model&rsquo; and &lsquo;I Am Tiger Woods.&rsquo;
Artist and photographer with permanent collections in several museums. Winner of too many awards to mention although
he&rsquo;d like us to. Teaches advertising in his spare time, benevolently terrorizing his pupils into greatness.</p>
